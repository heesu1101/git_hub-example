    "People tend to search the places before visiting a new country, state, city or place for their work. Moreover, if they are going to migrate completely, an analysis of their neighborhood is essential. To meet these needs, we usually need a search algorithm that returns the requested function, such as crime rate, average house price, population percentage, school grade, weather conditions, Distribution of restaurants, etc. Itâ€™d be nice to make a convenient program that allow us to analyze all of these features for a neighborhood or a comparative analysis between neighborhoods with just sending out the names of the neighborhoods.\n",

    "This project would help people to take a better decision on choosing the best neighborhood out of many neighborhoods to build/buy their houses in Seoul based on the distribution of various facilities in and around that neighborhood.\n",

    "This project uses K-mean clustering algorithm to cluster the venues based on the place category such as restaurants, gym, park, etc. This would give a better understanding of the similarities and dissimilarities between the two chosen neighborhoods to retrieve more insights and to conclude with ease which neighborhood wins over other."

Moreover, we can use Four-square API as its prime data gathering source. In particular, it provides a places API to do location searches and business details. Photos, tips and reviews taken by Foursquare users can be used in many productive ways."
